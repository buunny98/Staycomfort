I developed this project with the primary aim of highlighting my proficiency in backend development. While the website's frontend design may not be its focal point, my emphasis was placed on showcasing robust backend functionalities.

Utilizing a blend of PHP, JavaScript, AJAX, MySQL Database, CSS, and HTML, I created a website (Staycomfortz), a platform similar to a marketplace tailored for browsing hotel prices and enabling hotel owners to list their properties.

Prospective hotel owners can easily register through the provided page link. Upon registration, they gain access to the platform, empowering them to upload their hotel listings effortlessly.

In addition to hotel owners, registered members possess the capability to contribute to the platform by adding hotels. These contributions enrich the website's database, offering customers a diverse selection of accommodations to peruse at their convenience.
